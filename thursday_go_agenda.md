# Title
Solving Leetcode 150 in Golang

# Description

Join us for a collaborative LeetCode programming session!  We will be programming remotely.  The focus will be the Leetcode 150 study plan. We will be solving questions in golang.

  

Weâ€™ll kick things off with introductions before diving into two coding challengesâ€”one easy and one of medium difficulty.

For the first problem, weâ€™ll work together as a group, reading the question, brainstorming approaches, and debugging as we go. One person will take on the role of the â€˜driver,â€™ writing the code, while the rest of the group acts as â€˜navigators,â€™ providing guidance and suggestions. 

For the second problem, weâ€™ll again start with a group discussion before splitting into breakout rooms, where participants will work in pairs with one person acting as 'driver' and the other acting as the 'navigator'.  After completing the challenge, weâ€™ll regroup to review solutions, explore optimizations, and refine our code.

Whether you're new to coding interviews or looking to sharpen your skills, this session will provide a supportive environment to learn and practice together.

### Session Format (2 Hours)

ðŸ”¹ Introductions (5 min) â€“ Quick intros to get to know each other and set a friendly tone.
ðŸ”¹ Question Discussion (15-20 min) â€“ We introduce the topic for the session and collectively choose two questions from the LeetCode 75 list:

    One easy-level question focused on a specific topic to help beginners build foundational skills.
    One medium-level question for experienced developers to tackle a more complex challenge.

ðŸ”¹ Whiteboarding & Planning (20-30 min) â€“ Brainstorm solutions, sketch ideas, and discuss approaches as a group.
ðŸ”¹ Coding & Implementation (40-50 min) â€“ Work on your chosen question, test your code, and debug in real time. You can work individually or collaborate with others.
ðŸ”¹ Optimization & Review (10-15 min) â€“ Share and compare solutions, discuss optimizations, and analyze time/space complexity.
ðŸ”¹ Networking & Wrap-Up (Last 30 min) â€“ Connect with fellow developers, share insights, and wrap up the session with casual discussions.

Join us to code, learn, and grow in a welcoming communityâ€”regardless of your experience level! ðŸš€

# Title
Solving Leetcode 150 in Golang

# Description

Join us for a collaborative LeetCode programming session! The focus will be the Leetcode 150 study plan. We will be solving questions in golang.
  

We’ll kick things off with introductions before diving into two coding challenges—one easy and one of medium difficulty.

For the first problem, we’ll work together as a group, reading the question, brainstorming approaches, and debugging as we go. One person will take on the role of the ‘driver,’ writing the code, while the rest of the group acts as ‘navigators,’ providing guidance and suggestions. 

For the second problem, we’ll again start with a group discussion before splitting into breakout rooms, where participants will work in pairs with one person acting as 'driver' and the other acting as the 'navigator'.  After completing the challenge, we’ll regroup to review solutions, explore optimizations, and refine our code.

Whether you're new to coding interviews or looking to sharpen your skills, this session will provide a supportive environment to learn and practice together.

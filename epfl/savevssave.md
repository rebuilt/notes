# What's the difference between "save" and "save!"  ?
Notice that we're using #save! rather #save here. This is so that any errors related to saving the Comment will halt execution and give us a detailed error message. We used #save! when we first implemented the ideas#create action. For our learning process, #save! provides a useful and detailed error and is why we are using it here. A complete Rails application will use  #save along with specific logic to better respond to the error, as we have implemented in  ideas#create.
A more robust implementation of comments#create will use #save to handle errors and validation in a similar way to ideas#create. We would need to introduce conditional handling in the comments#create action and introduce somewhere to display error messages, and likely other logic. For the time being, we'll assume that all submitted comments are 100% correct; if they aren't, halt execution!

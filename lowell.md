Strengths:
Access to lots of data, at student level (assessments, Panorama)
Clear protocols around use of assessment data (e.g growth in iReady)
Student-level needs - easier to make action plan
Use of Ed Cat (feeding into Google Sheets), data in decision making
Use of student data to organize interventions and targeted improvements
Portrait of a Graduate at high school; aligning community values with data

Areas of improvement:
Sometimes oversaturation of data(math, Ela) but absence of data in other content areas and in other places(eg student engagement)
Do not use student grades as a data point
Survey data gets put into one bucket on the MCIEA dashboard
All of the above is not everywhere, but concentrated in some schools
Not all data is easily accessible to everyone
Do not have unified system to bring all the data together in one place
Need to be able to bring it all together to create holistic view
Build capacity for use of data

Comparison of school-wide data vs district data
More intermittent ongoing data collection, monitoring
Previous low response rates
Hesitance, skepticism about perceptions data

Once you have the data, teachers need time to analyze the data well.

Q. What's your experience with the SQM dashboard?
A. It's a consistent longitudinal measure of student and teacher opinions.

Q. How does the dashboard help?
A. It informs improvement planning. Other forms of data are not as helpful. Standardized test data is of limited utility when planning actionable improvements.SQM looks at other factors and helps identify meastures to improve and if they're making progress.

The recent pandemic has halted all improvement activities. Administrative policy has been about survival.  
They have only recently started to re-engage with the improvement process

The gap in data, 2019-2020, and the pandemic make it difficult to compare between years. It's important to be able to compare the different years.

The dashboard is limited because it can't slice the data in the ways he wants. He wants to filter by gender, ethnicity, etc.

He wants to know if the school is under/outperforming peers.

The dashboard affirmed conclusion that many teachers were not engaging students.

The dashboard helps identify improvement priorities.

He likes the stacked bar chart but wants to filter by other data as well so he can answer if some segments of the student population are underperforming. Are different sectors of the population getting a different experience at the school?

Q. How much of a difference is troubling?
Statistically significant variation

Using gpa as a factor can yeild insights. Filtering by test scores can tell you something about a student. You know if it's statistically significant if you can visually see the difference.

He wants controls, add filters by grade level (for example).
And filters should apply to multiple charts/visualisations so then can be visually compared.

He wants to export to csv so he can perform his own analysis.

He wants to create custom dashboards and view all those dashboards at once.

He wants to know if 80 percent approve of teachers, is that a good score or a bad score compared to other schools?

Q. Once you find points of interest, what do you do with it?

A. Charts and data should be easily exportable so they can be used in presentations

He wants to share it with other users so others can generate their own questions.

The dashboard helps identify what is not satisfactory.

The information prompts additional internal data collection with more focused questions.

Q. Concerns about how the data can be used. Who can access the data?

He has concerns about using the data in a public manner.

Some data is sensitive. For example, what the teachers say about their leadership team is sensitive.

Some answers are more targeted to specific individuals. When students give feedback about teachers, it's different than teachers giving feedback about the principal.

Data should be released only if there are no unintended consequences.

There must be access logs to see who accessed the data, and when.

Is there student identification information in the data? Yes, sasid[sic] and lasid[sic]

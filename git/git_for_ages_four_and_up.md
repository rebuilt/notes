# .git Directory

When you run `git init` it creates the `.git` folder.   Everything git knows is stored here.

# Basic commands
## Add
`git add` writes things to the repository.
## Commit

`git commit` takes what was written to the repository and puts labels on it.  e.g. HEAD and MASTER

### Reset to previous commit
`git reset --hard HEAD^`
